🃏 Blackjack (Twenty-One)

🎯 Overview

This project is a simple Blackjack (21) game that I built using Python.
The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 points without going over.
You play against the computer, which follows the standard Blackjack rules.

I created this project to practice my Python skills and improve my understanding of:

Loops and conditionals

Functions and code organization

Randomization (random.choice, random.choices)

List methods (append, insert, index, etc.)

Basic user interaction through the console

⚙ How the Game Works

1. Both the player and the computer start with two random cards.


2. If one of the cards is an Ace (1), it automatically becomes 11 if it doesn’t make the total go over 21.


3. The player can choose to draw another card or hold.


4. The computer keeps drawing cards until its score reaches 17 or more.


5. Finally, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

Work with lists, loops, and conditionals

Use randomization to simulate real gameplay

Make my code cleaner, more readable, and modular

Think logically like a programmer 🧩
